# Solar Panel Roof Efficiency Software - README

## Overview

Welcome to the Solar Panel Roof Efficiency Software, a tool for assessing the optimal alignment of solar panels on a roof for maximum power generation. This application calculates the ideal angle for solar panels based on the location, estimates solar power, and compares it with the current angle to determine power loss percentage.

- **Repository Title**: Solar Panel Roof Efficiency Software
- **Demo**: [View Demo](https://youtu.be/Tnf9YIUvr8Y)

## Features

### 1. Ideal Angle Calculation
- Determine the optimal angle for solar panels at the given location.

### 2. Solar Power Estimation
- Estimate solar power generation potential based on location and panel angle.

### 3. Power Loss Assessment
- Compare the estimated power at the ideal angle with the current angle.
- Calculate and display the percentage of power loss.

### 4. Visualization
- Present results with clear visualizations and relevant data.

### 5. Export and Report
- Export efficiency reports for further analysis or documentation.
