# Solar-Panel-Roof-Efficiency-Software
Welcome to the Solar Panel Roof Efficiency Software, a tool for assessing the optimal alignment of solar panels on a roof for maximum power generation. This application calculates the ideal angle for solar panels based on the location, estimates solar power, and compares it with the current angle to determine power loss percentage.
